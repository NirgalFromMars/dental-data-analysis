# API Response Example

This folder includes an example of the data retrieved from an open API source.

### Source
- **URL**: [California Open Data Portal – Dental Services 2021](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/dental-utilization-by-provider/resource/91c5cb49-16e1-4be3-9b97-cd65cdbf0525)

### Method of Access
The data was imported directly into Power BI using the Web connector. No authentication or transformation was required at the API level — Power BI handled the HTTP request and loaded the dataset as a table for further processing and visualization.

### Files Included
- **dental_data_2021_sample.json**: A sample response file saved locally for documentation purposes.

### Purpose
This file serves as a reference to document the structure and format of the data returned by the API in case offline inspection or replication is needed.
